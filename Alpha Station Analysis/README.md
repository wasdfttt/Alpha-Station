# Alpha Station Analysis
To analyze the data, run scopedataV2.py with the file path of where the data is stored. Change the region that calculates the baseline voltage on line 71 and the integration bounds on line 98 if necessary. Line 118 may also need to be changed as it filters out waveforms below a certain amount of charge.

If the waveform plots look good, then run Alpha Station Gain Effect.py with the same parameters. The only parameters that need to be changed in this code will be lines 24-37. It will print a list of the means that can be used in Gain Plot.ipynb to create a plot of the gain as a function of angle. If there is a curve fit error, you may have to increase the value of sdDiff on line 34 to 5. If that does not work, then try taking out all of the other angles from the directory and running the code for just the angle that failed the curve fit. If you cannot get the curve fit on Alpha Station Gain Effect.py to work, then take the average charge deposited from the scopedatav2.py plots and divide by the average PIN charge to obtain the average gain. If the scopedatav2.py plot also cannot curve fit, either the parameters of the integration region and/or baseline voltage calculation are incorrect or the distribution may be flat. In the case that it is a flat distribution, you will have to determine the average charge deposited by eye.
